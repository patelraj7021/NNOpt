Task breakdown:
1. For NN config optimization:
 - check coarsely first (2, 32, 64, 96, 128)
 - scan through popular choices for optimizer
 - scan through finer layer choices with longer epochs
 - vary batch size? probably not, but look into it
 - get train_model func to return model, try predicting
 - check what's happening with cost_comp return object
 - convert to async map?
