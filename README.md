Functionality goals:
1. For a regression problem for a given dataset, determine the 
  neural network (NN) configuration that best fits the data
2. Compare performance (i.e., residuals) of the optimal NN with a 
  parametric model and determine the level of similarity between
  the two
3. Create a SOM to fit a given dataset and compare against PCA; 
  determine the level of non-linearity of the features
